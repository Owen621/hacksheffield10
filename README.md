WARDROBE ODYSSEY

Track every clothing item's journey with on-chain stamps and earn loyalty points

- Upload clothing

- Retailers can plug in later for rewards etc

How to get it running:
Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (for minting and token scripts)
- PostgreSQL or SQLite (for local development)

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd backend/static/js
npm install

python app.py

You will need to install phantom on web store to use most functionality:
